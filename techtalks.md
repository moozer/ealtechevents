What are tech talks?
--------------------

A EAL Tech-Talk is a evening consisting of 4-5 talks about variouse topics. A topic can either be
a generel, technical or a specific tool talk. They are scheduled for the last Thursday of the month

The talks are held by anybody with a passion for a specific subject and willing to give a talk. After the talks there will be a workshop where you are able to work with some of the tools or technical aspects presented during the talks

* General talks present some technical topic or trend with broad ramifications that will be of relevance to most people.

* Technical talks covers a technology, and are presented in a non-technical manner. These topics will be chosen to introduce people to an underlying technology, that they might not work with directly, but will have relevance for their day-to-day work

* Tool talks are talks about specific tools or software, that is useful any technical person and others. These are intended to give the audience an impression of how easy it is get startet with the specific tool and how it could benefit them.

After the talks, the tools presenters will be available for questions and hand-on support, if needed.
