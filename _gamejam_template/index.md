In a GameJam you find groups in which you have 48 hours to come up with a game. Be it a computergame, card game or board game.
A keyword will be drawn which the game has to encompass.
At the end of the gamejam every group has 10 minutes to show off their games and after that everybody get to vote on which other teams game was best.
The winners get all the glory!
